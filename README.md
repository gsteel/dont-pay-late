# Late Payment Calculator Website

[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/gsteel/dont-pay-late/actions/workflows/continuous-integration.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gsteel/dont-pay-late/actions/workflows/continuous-integration.yml)

This is a little site I built many years ago to calculate interest and debt recovery fees on UK commercial debt, for obvious reasons.

Back then, I used the project to get to grips with `Zend\Expressive`, a psr-7 micro framework. It ran, unchanged for many years.

`Zend\Expressive` is long dead and was replaced by/renamed to [Mezzio](https://github.com/mezzio/mezzio) so this `v2.x` branch is a rebuild with Mezzio and various other [`Laminas`](https://github.com/laminas) components.

The site in its current form can be seen at [https://dontpaylate.uk](https://dontpaylate.uk).

Please feel free to kick the tyres and have a look around. It might be useful if you are learning Mezzio yourself ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Ä¶
